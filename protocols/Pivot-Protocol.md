# SPARK Pivot Protocol

## When Everything Changes: The SPARK Pivot Response

### The 48-Hour Pivot Protocol

#### Day 1: Acknowledge & Assess (4 hours)
**Morning (2 hours) - Team Gathering:**
1. **Acknowledgment Ritual** (30 min)
   - Everyone shares one thing they're proud of from previous direction
   - CEO acknowledges team's good work wasn't "wasted" - it was learning
   - Frame as "graduation" not "failure"

2. **Asset Inventory** (90 min)
   - Technical: What code/systems can transfer?
   - Knowledge: What customer insights apply?
   - Process: What workflows are still valuable?
   - Team: What skills are now more/less relevant?

**Afternoon (2 hours) - New Direction:**
3. **New OKR Workshop** (90 min)
   - Draft new quarterly objectives
   - Identify 3-5 key results for new direction
   - Align on success metrics

4. **Quick Backlog Seed** (30 min)
   - Create 5-10 highest priority items for new direction
   - Link each to new OKRs
   - Don't overthink - just start

#### Day 2: Reorganize & Restart (2 hours)
**Morning (1 hour) - Board Reset:**
1. **Archive Old Work**
   - Move irrelevant items to "Archived" column
   - Preserve items that transfer to new direction
   - Clear "In Progress" - everyone starts fresh

2. **New Board Setup**
   - Populate backlog with new direction items
   - Everyone pulls ONE item aligned with new OKRs
   - Start shipping in new direction immediately

**Afternoon (1 hour) - Team Sync:**
3. **Pivot Retrospective**
   - What did we learn that helps us now?
   - What assumptions were wrong?
   - How can we pivot faster next time?
   - What early signals should we watch for?

### Morale Protection Strategies

#### The "Learning Ledger"
- Document every insight from previous direction
- Create "What We Learned" artifact
- Show how insights inform new direction
- Frame previous work as "expensive education, cheap tuition"

#### The "Skills Translation"
- Map how everyone's work translates to new direction
- Identify new learning opportunities
- Celebrate adaptability over domain expertise

#### The "Velocity Preservation"
- Maintain SPARK rituals (check-ins, retros)
- Keep team members together when possible
- Preserve high-performing dynamics

### Pivot Success Metrics

**Speed Metrics:**
- Time to new OKRs: < 1 day
- Time to first new feature shipped: < 1 week
- Team productivity recovery: 80% within 2 weeks

**Morale Metrics:**
- Team satisfaction during pivot: > 7/10
- Retention rate post-pivot: > 90%
- Learning capture rate: Document insights from 100% of abandoned work

**Strategic Metrics:**
- % of previous work that transfers: Measure and improve
- Pivot decision quality: Track if pivots stick for > 6 months

### Common Pivot Pitfalls & SPARK Solutions

| Pitfall | Traditional Response | SPARK Response |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| Analysis paralysis on what to keep | Weeks of architecture meetings | 90-min asset inventory, then start |
| Team demoralization | Manager pep talks | Structured acknowledgment ritual |
| Lost momentum | Planning phases | Immediate new work pulling |
| Unclear new direction | Detailed requirements docs | Simple OKRs + learn by shipping |
| Context switching chaos | Formal transition plan | Clean board reset + WIP limits |

### Pivot Gradations

**Micro-Pivot** (Feature level)
- Use standard weekly retro
- Adjust OKRs, not replace them
- Archive specific features, not whole direction

**Macro-Pivot** (Product level)  
- Use 48-hour protocol
- Replace OKRs entirely
- Team reset process

**Mega-Pivot** (Business model)
- 48-hour protocol + leadership alignment
- Consider team restructuring
- May require multiple pods with different OKRs

### Integration with Core SPARK

This becomes a new "emergency protocol" that activates when:
- >50% of current backlog becomes irrelevant
- New OKRs conflict with existing ones
- Leadership declares direction change

The protocol preserves SPARK principles:
- Outcome-focused (new OKRs)
- Minimal ceremony (48 hours total)
- Flow-based (immediate restart)
- Learning-oriented (capture insights)
- Team autonomy (everyone pulls new work)
