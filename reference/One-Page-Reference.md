# SPARK™ - One Page Reference

## Is SPARK Right for You?

**✅ Use SPARK when:**
- Work can be decomposed into small deliverable pieces
- Team has autonomy over how work gets done
- Clear connection to measurable business outcomes
- Willingness to learn through regular reflection

**❌ Avoid SPARK when:**
- Physical processes with fixed schedules
- Pure research with no business outcome
- Command-and-control prevents team autonomy
- No one available to prioritize and align stakeholders

## Five SPARK Principles
1. **Single-Piece Flow** - One item per person (teaching tool, not rigid rule)
2. **Pull, Don't Push** - Take work when ready, not when assigned
3. **Amplify Learning** - Weekly retrospectives build team capability
4. **Radically Minimize Waste** - Eliminate non-value-adding activities
5. **Keep It Simple** - Framework must be teachable in one hour

## Team Scaling Guide

**Solo (1):** Personal board + OKRs, ceremonies for planning/reflection  
**Small (2-4):** Full SPARK with tight coordination  
**Optimal (5-10):** Sweet spot for autonomy and diverse skills  
**Growing (10-15):** Monitor for splitting signals  
**Large (15+):** Split into autonomous pods

## The SPARK Week (< 2 hours total)

| Day | Ritual | Time | Format |
|-----|--------|------|--------|
| Monday | Focus | 15 min | "This week I'm shipping X for KR Y" |
| Wednesday | Blockers | 15 min | "I need help with Z" or "All clear" |
| Friday | Learn | 45 min | Metrics → Insights → Process improvements |

## Work Item Anatomy

│ TITLE: Clear ask        │

│ CONTEXT: Past attempts  │

## Core Power: Context Preservation
Tasks accumulate knowledge across cycles:
- What was tried before
- Why approaches didn't work  
- Current constraints and next steps
- Business insights from reviews

**Result:** Any team member can pick up any task productively.

## Quick Start Checklist
- [ ] Set up 4-column board (Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done)
- [ ] Define quarterly OKRs (1-2 objectives, 3-5 KRs each)
- [ ] Fill backlog with small, KR-linked items (1-2 days max)
- [ ] Apply WIP limit of 1 (break for pairing/emergencies when needed)
- [ ] Schedule weekly ceremonies
- [ ] Start pulling work!

## Metrics That Matter
**Flow:** Cycle Time | Throughput | Flow Efficiency  
**Outcomes:** OKR Progress | Customer Impact  
**Health:** Team Energy | Learning Velocity

## Principles Over Rules
- WIP limit forces "fastest path to Done" conversation
- Principles win when rules conflict with customer value
- Done means value delivered (shipped features, captured learning)
- Context preservation prevents knowledge loss
- Retrospectives build team capability

## Forecasting vs Estimation
**Daily Work:** Decompose to 1-2 day atomic pieces  
**Larger Initiatives:** T-shirt sizes with confidence ranges  
**Business Planning:** Themes roadmap with quarterly OKRs  
**Hybrid Contexts:** Use SPARK internally + traditional estimation externally

## Transition Paths

**From Scrum:** Add OKRs → Drop sprint planning → Async check-ins → SPARK (4 weeks)  
**From Kanban:** Add OKRs + WIP limits → Friday retros → SPARK (3 days)  
**From Waterfall:** Break into deliverables → Add board → Iterations + retros → SPARK (4 months)
