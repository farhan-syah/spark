# SPARK Framework

> Swift Product Acceleration through Rapid Knowledge

A lightweight project management framework for solo developers and high-velocity teams (1-10 people) that need to move fast while maintaining quality.

## Why SPARK?

Traditional project management frameworks assume predictable environments. **SPARK is designed for fast-moving teams.**

- **Minimal meeting overhead** (less than 2 hours/week)
- **Continuous flow** instead of batched sprints
- **Pull-based work** instead of assignment-heavy planning
- **Context preservation** - Knowledge compounds across task iterations
- **Clear workspace architecture** - One workspace, one board, one objective prevents organizational chaos
- **Smart scaling** - 5-10 people per pod, scale by adding independent pods (not people)

## Quick Start

**Read [SPARK.md](SPARK.md)** - Everything you need to know in 10-15 minutes.

**TL;DR:** 4-column board + WIP limit of 1 in Progress column + quarterly OKRs + 3 weekly meetings (75 minutes total).

## Core Principles

1. **Single-Piece Flow** - Work moves continuously, one item at a time per person
2. **Pull, Don't Push** - Team members pull work when ready
3. **Amplify Learning** - Every week, the team gets smarter
4. **Radically Minimize Waste** - Eliminate non-value-adding activities
5. **Keep It Simple** - The framework must be teachable in one hour

## What's Different?

**SPARK's Unique Approach:**
- **Radical autonomy** - Each pod is fully self-contained
- **Outcome obsession** - Every work item must advance a Key Result  
- **Knowledge compounds** - Context preservation across all work
- **Scale by splitting** - Add pods, never add complexity

See the [comprehensive framework comparison](SPARK.md#how-spark-differs-from-other-frameworks) for detailed differences vs. Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, and SAFe.

## Key Features

### SPARK's Core Power: Context Preservation
When tasks cycle through Review â†’ Backlog (due to rejection), they accumulate technical context, business insights, and implementation approaches. This means ANY team member can pick up ANY task with full understanding of what's been tried and why.

### Optional AI Development Support
- **Level 0**: Use core SPARK without AI enhancements
- **Level 1-3**: Progressive adoption of AI-assisted development features
- All AI features remain completely optional - framework works perfectly without them
- See [SPARK.md#advanced-considerations](SPARK.md#advanced-considerations) for details

### Recognition System
Flow-based recognition focusing on throughput, quality, learning contributions, and collaboration. See [SPARK.md#recognition-and-rewards](SPARK.md#recognition-and-rewards).

**Remember**: The goal isn't to follow SPARK perfectly. The goal is to ship value sustainably while building resilient teams. SPARK is a means to that end.
