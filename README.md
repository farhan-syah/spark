# SPARK Framework

> Swift Product Acceleration through Rapid Knowledge

A lightweight project management framework for building high-performing teams. It addresses common failure modes in growing organizations—such as decreased velocity, conflicting priorities, and excessive process overhead—by providing a simple, teachable system.

## Why SPARK?

By combining principles from Agile, Lean, and modern product thinking, SPARK delivers three key outcomes:

- **Clarity & Focus** - Eliminates ambiguity by ensuring every team is focused on a single, measurable objective
- **Sustainable Speed** - Creates a system of continuous flow, preventing burnout and waste
- **Scalable Autonomy** - Provides a clear model for organizational growth that preserves the speed and agility of a small team

**Key Features:**
- **Minimal meeting overhead** (less than 2 hours/week)
- **Forecasting without estimation** - Lightweight planning that satisfies business needs
- **Context preservation** - Knowledge compounds across task iterations
- **Cross-pod dependencies** - Structured approach to managing team interdependencies
- **Smart scaling** - Pod structure that scales by replication, not complexity

## Quick Start

**Read [SPARK.md](SPARK.md)** - Everything you need to know in 10-15 minutes.

**TL;DR:** 4-column board + WIP limit of 1 in Progress column + quarterly OKRs + themes roadmap + 3 weekly meetings (75 minutes total).

## Core Principles

1. **Single-Piece Flow** - Work moves continuously, one item at a time per person
2. **Pull, Don't Push** - Team members pull work when ready
3. **Amplify Learning** - Every week, the team gets smarter
4. **Radically Minimize Waste** - Eliminate non-value-adding activities
5. **Keep It Simple** - The framework must be teachable in one hour

## What's Different?

**SPARK's Unique Approach:**
- **Radical autonomy** - Each pod is fully self-contained
- **Outcome obsession** - Every work item must advance a Key Result  
- **Knowledge compounds** - Context preservation across all work
- **Scale by splitting** - Add pods, never add complexity

See the [comprehensive framework comparison](SPARK.md#how-spark-differs-from-other-frameworks) for detailed differences vs. Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall, and SAFe.

## Key Features

### SPARK's Core Power: Context Preservation
When tasks cycle through Review → Backlog (due to rejection), they accumulate technical context, business insights, and implementation approaches. This means ANY team member can pick up ANY task with full understanding of what's been tried and why.

### Optional AI Development Support
- **Level 0**: Use core SPARK without AI enhancements
- **Level 1-3**: Progressive adoption of AI-assisted development features
- All AI features remain completely optional - framework works perfectly without them
- See [SPARK.md#advanced-considerations](SPARK.md#advanced-considerations) for details

### Recognition System
Flow-based recognition focusing on throughput, quality, learning contributions, and collaboration. See [SPARK.md#recognition-and-rewards](SPARK.md#recognition-and-rewards).
