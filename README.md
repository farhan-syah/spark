## Why SPARK?

Traditional project management frameworks assume predictable environments. **SPARK is designed for fast-moving teams.**

- **Minimal meeting overhead** (less than 2 hours/week)
- **Continuous flow** instead of batched sprints
- **Pull-based work** instead of assignment-heavy planning
- **Simple scaling** from 1-50 people with pod structure

## Quick Start

**Read [SPARK.md](SPARK.md)** - Everything you need to know in 10-15 minutes.

**TL;DR:** 4-column board + WIP limit of 1 (adjustable) + quarterly OKRs + 3 weekly meetings (75 minutes total).

## Core Principles

1. **Single-Piece Flow** - Work moves continuously, one item at a time per person
2. **Pull, Don't Push** - Team members pull work when ready
3. **Amplify Learning** - Every week, the team gets smarter
4. **Radically Minimize Waste** - Eliminate non-value-adding activities
5. **Keep It Simple** - The framework must be teachable in one hour

## What's Different?

### vs. Scrum
- **Continuous flow** instead of 2-week sprints
- **Pull-based work** instead of sprint planning
- **Async ceremonies** instead of daily standups
- **Simple disruption handling** built into the framework

### vs. Kanban
- **OKRs provide direction** instead of just visualizing flow
- **WIP limits enforced** to prevent overcommitment
- **Built-in learning** through weekly retrospectives
- **Guidance for common problems** included

### vs. Shape Up
- **Faster cycles** (continuous vs 6-week cycles)
- **Works for small teams** (1-10 people primarily)
- **Simpler onboarding** (learn in 1 hour)
- **Less overhead** (no circuit breakers, betting tables, etc.)

## Designed for Common Startup Challenges

SPARK includes guidance for handling typical disruptions:

- **Direction changes** - How to pivot without losing momentum
- **Customer emergencies** - Balancing urgent issues with planned work
- **Knowledge loss** - When key team members leave
- **External dependencies** - Managing third-party service issues
- **Scaling pressure** - Growing the team without losing velocity

The framework provides structured approaches that maintain team focus while addressing these challenges.

## Documentation Structure
