# SPARK Framework - Teaching & Adoption Guide

## For Scrum Masters & Agile Coaches

### How to Position SPARK to Your Team

**Don't Say:**
"We're abandoning Scrum for something completely new"

**Do Say:**
"We're evolving our Agile practice to be even more agile"

### Mapping Scrum → SPARK

| Scrum Concept | SPARK Equivalent | Why It's Better |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Sprint Planning | Continuous Backlog Refinement | No 4-hour meetings, pull when ready |
| Daily Standup | Async Check-ins | Respect people's flow state |
| Sprint Review | Continuous Delivery | Ship daily, learn faster |
| Sprint Retrospective | Weekly Retro | More frequent = more learning |
| Story Points | Cycle Time | Measure actual delivery, not estimates |
| Scrum Master | Rotating Facilitator | Everyone owns the process |
| Product Owner | Product Owner | Same role, less ceremony |
| Sprint Goal | OKRs | Outcome-focused, longer horizon |

### The Transition Conversation

**Week 1 Kickoff Speech:**
"Team, we've been doing Scrum well, but we're spending 20% of our time in ceremonies. What if we could cut that to 2% and ship twice as much? Let's try SPARK for one month. If it doesn't work, we'll go back to Scrum with lessons learned."

## Workshop Materials

### Exercise 1: Calculate Your Ceremony Tax

Have the team calculate:
- Sprint Planning: ___ hours × team size
- Daily Standups: ___ hours × 5 days × team size  
- Sprint Review: ___ hours × team size
- Retrospective: ___ hours × team size
- Backlog Refinement: ___ hours × team size

**Total: ___ hours/sprint**

"What could we build with those hours instead?"

### Exercise 2: Create Your First OKRs

Template:
```
Objective: [Inspiring goal that matters to customers]
KR1: [Measurable outcome, not output]
KR2: [Another measurable outcome]
KR3: [Third measurable outcome]
```

Common mistakes to avoid:
- ❌ "Complete 50 story points" (that's output)
- ✅ "Reduce checkout abandonment by 20%" (that's outcome)

### Exercise 3: Design Your Board

On a whiteboard, draw:
```
BACKLOG | IN PROGRESS | REVIEW | DONE
        |   (Max: 1)  |        |
```

Have each person:
1. Write one work item
2. Connect it to an OKR
3. Practice moving it across the board

## Overcoming Resistance

### "But we need sprints for predictability!"

**Response:** "SPARK gives better predictability through consistent cycle time. Instead of guessing with story points, we measure how long things actually take and use that data."

### "One item per person? That's too limiting!"

**Response:** "It's not limiting—it's focusing. Multitasking kills productivity. Try it for two weeks and measure your throughput."

### "We need more structure!"

**Response:** "SPARK has structure—it's just minimal. OKRs for direction, WIP limits for focus, retros for improvement. What specific structure do you feel is missing?"

### "Our stakeholders expect sprint demos!"

**Response:** "They can see progress daily in production. Plus, we'll send weekly updates showing OKR progress—more valuable than feature demos."

### "What about our Jira workflows?"

**Response:** "Keep using Jira! Just simplify to 4 columns. SPARK is tool-agnostic."

## Success Stories to Share

### Story 1: The Startup
"A 5-person startup switched from Scrum to SPARK. They went from shipping every 2 weeks to shipping daily. Their investor updates changed from 'we're on track' to 'here's what customers used this week.'"

### Story 2: The Enterprise Team  
"A team inside BigCorp was drowning in SAFe ceremonies. They piloted SPARK, cut meetings by 90%, and became the highest-performing team in the division. Now they're teaching other teams."

### Story 3: The Remote Team
"A distributed team struggled with timezone-spanning standups. SPARK's async approach meant everyone could contribute on their schedule. Productivity doubled."

## Measurement & Reporting

### Week 1 Baseline
Measure before starting:
- Current cycle time
- Weekly throughput  
- Meeting hours
- Team satisfaction

### Weekly Metrics Email
```
Subject: SPARK Week 3 Update

OKR Progress:
• KR1: 35% complete ↑
• KR2: 50% complete ↑  
• KR3: 20% complete →

Flow Metrics:
• Shipped: 12 items
• Cycle time: 2.1 days ↓
• Blocked: 1 item

Key Learning:
Reviews going faster after implementing 24hr SLA

Next Week:
Continuing focus on KR2 features
```

### Monthly Stakeholder Report
- OKR achievement percentage
- Cycle time trend chart
- Throughput run chart
- Key learnings & pivots
- Next month focus

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Keeping Too Much Process
**Symptom:** Still doing standups, planning, etc.
**Fix:** Trust the framework. Cut deeper.

### 2. Ignoring WIP Limits
**Symptom:** Multiple items in progress
**Fix:** Hard rule. Visible board. Team accountability.

### 3. Vague OKRs  
**Symptom:** Can't measure progress
**Fix:** If you can't graph it, it's not a KR

### 4. Skipping Retros
**Symptom:** Same problems week after week
**Fix:** Calendar block. Most important meeting.

### 5. Work Items Too Large
**Symptom:** Items sit in progress for weeks
**Fix:** Break down ruthlessly. 1 week max.
