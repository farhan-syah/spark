# SPARK Framework - Teaching & Adoption Guide

## For Scrum Masters & Agile Coaches

### First: Is SPARK Right for Your Team?

Before introducing SPARK, help your team assess fit:

**‚úÖ SPARK Works Well When:**
- Work can be decomposed into small deliverable pieces
- Team has autonomy over how work gets done  
- Clear connection to measurable business outcomes
- Willingness to learn through regular reflection

**‚ùå Consider Alternatives When:**
- Physical processes with fixed schedules
- Pure research with no business outcome
- Command-and-control prevents team autonomy
- No one available to prioritize and align stakeholders

**üîß Can Work With Adaptations:**
- Fixed-scope contracts (use SPARK internally + traditional estimation externally)
- Highly interdependent work (coordinate closely, use pairing/swarming)
- Compliance requirements (add as additional review criteria)
- Distributed teams (leverage async ceremonies)

### How to Position SPARK to Your Team

**Don't Say:**
"We're abandoning Scrum for something completely new"

**Do Say:**
"We're optimizing our Agile practice for maximum customer impact with minimum ceremony"

### Mapping Scrum ‚Üí SPARK

| Scrum Concept | SPARK Equivalent | Why It's Better |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Sprint Planning | Continuous Backlog + Decomposition | No 4-hour meetings, pull when ready |
| Daily Standup | Mon/Wed Check-ins | Async-friendly, flow-state preserving |
| Sprint Review | Continuous Delivery | Ship daily, learn faster |
| Sprint Retrospective | Weekly Learning Retro | More frequent improvement cycles |
| Story Points | Cycle Time + Throughput | Measure actual delivery speed |
| Scrum Master | Shared Facilitation | Everyone owns the process |
| Product Owner | Product Owner | Same role, clearer OKR focus |
| Sprint Goal | Quarterly OKRs | Outcome-focused, strategic horizon |

### The Transition Conversation

**Week 1 Kickoff Speech:**
"Team, we've been doing Scrum well, but we're spending 20% of our time in ceremonies while context switching between multiple work items. SPARK will help us focus on one thing at a time, preserve our learnings, and spend more time creating customer value. Let's try it for one month. If it doesn't work, we'll return to Scrum with valuable lessons learned."

**Key Selling Points:**
- **Context Preservation:** Knowledge stays with work items, not individuals
- **Focus Over Busy:** WIP limits teach us the fastest path to "Done"  
- **Decomposition Over Estimation:** Break work small instead of guessing sizes
- **Learning Loops:** Weekly retrospectives build team capability

---

## Creating the Right Environment

While SPARK is designed to be simple and adaptable, certain environmental factors significantly increase the likelihood of success:

### Team Readiness Prerequisites
- **Decomposition skills** - Ability to break work into 1-2 day deliverable pieces (can be learned)
- **Communication comfort** - Members feel safe raising blockers and sharing context
- **Learning orientation** - Focus on continuous improvement over blame
- **Outcome mindset** - Willingness to measure success by customer impact

### Leadership Support Requirements  
- **Servant leadership** - Leaders remove obstacles rather than assign work
- **Autonomy protection** - Shield teams from micromanagement and constant re-prioritization
- **Patience with change** - Allow 4+ weeks for new patterns to emerge
- **Trust in process** - Support WIP limits even when they feel counterintuitive initially

### Cultural Shifts to Guide
- **From busy to focused** - One item in progress is more productive than three
- **From estimation to forecasting** - Use cycle time and decomposition instead of story points
- **From push to pull** - Team members choose work when ready
- **From individual to collective knowledge** - Context belongs to work items, not people
- **From feature factory to outcome engine** - Celebrate learning and pivots as much as shipping

These aren't rigid requirements, but teams with these characteristics tend to adopt SPARK more successfully and see faster results.

## Workshop Materials

### Exercise 1: Calculate Your Ceremony Tax

Have the team calculate:
- Sprint Planning: ___ hours √ó team size
- Daily Standups: ___ hours √ó 5 days √ó team size  
- Sprint Review: ___ hours √ó team size
- Retrospective: ___ hours √ó team size
- Backlog Refinement: ___ hours √ó team size

**Total: ___ hours/sprint**

"What could we build with those hours instead?"

### Exercise 2: Create Your First OKRs

Template:
```
Objective: [Inspiring goal that matters to customers]
KR1: [Measurable outcome, not output]
KR2: [Another measurable outcome]
KR3: [Third measurable outcome]
```

Common mistakes to avoid:
- ‚ùå "Complete 50 story points" (that's output)
- ‚úÖ "Reduce checkout abandonment by 20%" (that's outcome)

### Exercise 3: Design Your Board

On a whiteboard, draw:
```
BACKLOG | IN PROGRESS | REVIEW | DONE
        |   (Max: 1)  |        |
```

Have each person:
1. Write one work item
2. Connect it to an OKR
3. Practice moving it across the board

## Overcoming Resistance

### "But we need sprints for predictability!"

**Response:** "SPARK gives better predictability through consistent cycle time. Instead of guessing with story points, we measure how long things actually take and use that data."

### "One item per person? That's too limiting!"

**Response:** "The WIP limit is a teaching tool, not a rigid rule. It forces us to ask: 'What's the fastest way to get this specific item to Done?' Sometimes that means pairing, sometimes swarming, sometimes strategic rule-breaking for emergencies. The goal is focus and flow, not perfect rule compliance."

### "We need more structure!"

**Response:** "SPARK has structure‚Äîit's just minimal. OKRs for direction, WIP limits for focus, retros for improvement. What specific structure do you feel is missing?"

### "Our stakeholders expect sprint demos!"

**Response:** "They can see progress daily in production. Plus, we'll send weekly updates showing OKR progress‚Äîmore valuable than feature demos."

### "What about our Jira workflows?"

**Response:** "Keep using Jira! Just simplify to 4 columns. SPARK is tool-agnostic."

## Success Stories to Share

### Story 1: The Startup
"A 5-person startup switched from Scrum to SPARK. They went from shipping every 2 weeks to shipping daily. Their investor updates changed from 'we're on track' to 'here's what customers used this week.'"

### Story 2: The Enterprise Team  
"A team inside BigCorp was drowning in SAFe ceremonies. They piloted SPARK, cut meetings by 90%, and became the highest-performing team in the division. Now they're teaching other teams."

### Story 3: The Remote Team
"A distributed team struggled with timezone-spanning standups. SPARK's async approach meant everyone could contribute on their schedule. Productivity doubled."

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. Keeping Too Much Process
**Symptom:** Still doing standups, planning, etc.
**Fix:** Trust the framework. Cut deeper.

### 2. Ignoring WIP Limits
**Symptom:** Multiple items in progress
**Fix:** Hard rule. Visible board. Team accountability.

### 3. Vague OKRs  
**Symptom:** Can't measure progress
**Fix:** If you can't graph it, it's not a KR

### 4. Skipping Retros
**Symptom:** Same problems week after week
**Fix:** Calendar block. Most important meeting.

### 5. Work Items Too Large
**Symptom:** Items sit in progress for weeks
**Fix:** Decompose to 1-2 days max. Focus on deliverable outcomes, not task completion.

### 6. Missing Context Preservation
**Symptom:** Work gets "lost" when people leave or forget details
**Fix:** Capture what was tried, why it didn't work, and next steps on work items. Context should enable anyone to pick up any task productively.
