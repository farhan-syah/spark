# SPARK Framework - Critical Startup Scenarios

## 10 High-Velocity Startup Challenges

### Scenario 1: "The Pivot Disaster"
**Situation:** CEO announces pivot on Monday. Need to completely change product direction while preserving some core features. Team of 8 people, existing OKRs are now useless.

**Challenge:** How do you rapidly realign the entire team without losing momentum or creating chaos?

**Key Pain Points:**
- Existing work becomes irrelevant overnight
- Team morale drops (wasted effort)
- New priorities unclear
- Technical debt from old direction

---

### Scenario 2: "The Funding Deadline Crunch"
**Situation:** 6 weeks to demo product to Series A investors. Core feature is 70% done but buggy. Marketing wants 3 new "wow" features. Engineering says impossible.

**Challenge:** Balance technical quality vs. impressive demo features under extreme time pressure.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Competing priorities (polish vs. new features)
- Technical shortcuts vs. long-term stability
- Team burnout risk
- Stakeholder pressure

---

### Scenario 3: "The Key Developer Quit"
**Situation:** Lead developer who built 60% of the codebase gives 2 weeks notice. Documentation is sparse. Knowledge transfer time is minimal.

**Challenge:** Maintain velocity while transferring critical knowledge and preventing single points of failure.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Knowledge silos
- Institutional memory loss
- Reduced team capacity
- Risk of technical paralysis

---

### Scenario 4: "The Customer Emergency"
**Situation:** Biggest customer (40% of revenue) reports critical bug affecting their business. Meanwhile, team is focused on new feature for next customer acquisition push.

**Challenge:** Handle urgent customer issues without derailing planned feature development.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Interrupt-driven development
- Conflicting priorities (retention vs. growth)
- Context switching costs
- Customer satisfaction vs. roadmap

---

### Scenario 5: "The Feature Factory Trap"
**Situation:** Sales team keeps promising custom features to close deals. Engineering backlog has 30+ "critical" features. Nothing gets finished properly.

**Challenge:** Say no to feature requests while maintaining sales momentum and team focus.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Feature creep
- Nothing ships completely
- Technical debt accumulation
- Team scattered focus

---

### Scenario 6: "The Scale Surprise"
**Situation:** Product goes viral over weekend. 100x traffic increase. System crashes. Team scrambling to fix performance issues while maintaining new user growth.

**Challenge:** Handle unexpected scale while continuing product development.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Infrastructure fire-fighting
- Performance vs. feature trade-offs
- All hands on deck (but for how long?)
- Technical debt from quick fixes

---

### Scenario 7: "The Dependency Hell"
**Situation:** Core feature depends on 3rd party API that keeps changing. Integration breaks every few weeks. Team spends 30% of time fixing integration issues.

**Challenge:** Manage external dependencies without losing development velocity.

**Key Pain Points:**
- External dependency fragility
- Unpredictable maintenance overhead
- Build vs. buy decisions
- Risk management

---

### Scenario 8: "The Team Doubling"
**Situation:** Just raised Series A. Need to double team size in 3 months. New hires need to be productive quickly but current team has no time for onboarding.

**Challenge:** Scale team rapidly without sacrificing current productivity or code quality.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Onboarding overhead
- Knowledge transfer bottlenecks
- Process doesn't scale
- Culture dilution risk

---

### Scenario 9: "The Competitor Launch"
**Situation:** Well-funded competitor launches similar product with 2x the features. Customers asking why they should choose your product. Pressure to match features quickly.

**Challenge:** Respond to competitive pressure without losing product focus or engineering quality.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Feature parity pressure
- Reactive vs. strategic planning
- Team morale (feeling behind)
- Resource allocation conflicts

---

### Scenario 10: "The Regulatory Bomb"
**Situation:** New regulations (GDPR, SOC2, etc.) require significant security/compliance features. Customers won't buy without certification. 3-month compliance deadline.

**Challenge:** Implement compliance requirements without stopping product development.

**Key Pain Points:**
- Non-feature development time
- Expertise gaps (security/compliance)
- Customer acquisition blocker
- Documentation and process overhead

---

## Testing Framework

For each scenario, we'll evaluate:

1. **Recognition:** Does SPARK help identify this problem early?
2. **Response:** Does SPARK provide clear guidance on how to respond?
3. **Recovery:** Does SPARK help teams recover quickly?
4. **Prevention:** Does SPARK prevent this scenario from occurring?

### Evaluation Criteria

- ‚úÖ **Fully Handled:** SPARK directly addresses this scenario
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Handled:** SPARK helps but needs enhancement
- ‚ùå **Not Handled:** SPARK doesn't address this scenario
- üîÑ **Framework Update Needed:** Requires SPARK modification

## Next Steps

We'll go through each scenario one by one to test how well SPARK handles real startup challenges and identify where the framework needs enhancement.
