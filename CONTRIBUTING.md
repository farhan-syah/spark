# Contributing to SPARK Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SPARK! This framework is community-driven and benefits from real-world experience and feedback.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Experience Reports
**Most Valuable Contribution**

Share how SPARK worked (or didn't work) for your team:
- Team size and context
- Which parts of SPARK you implemented
- What worked well
- What was challenging
- Specific outcomes/metrics
- Lessons learned

Submit as GitHub issues with the `experience-report` label.

### 2. Framework Improvements
Enhance existing disruption handling or suggest new approaches:
- Test framework guidance in real scenarios
- Suggest improvements based on experience
- Propose new disruption patterns we haven't covered
- Document edge cases and solutions

### 3. Tool Integrations
Help teams adopt SPARK with their existing tools:
- Trello board templates
- Notion workspace templates
- Linear workflow setups
- Jira configurations
- Custom tooling and scripts

### 4. Documentation Improvements
- Fix typos and unclear explanations
- Add examples and case studies
- Improve visual diagrams
- Translate to other languages

5. **Define success metrics** - How to know if it's working

### For Tool Integrations
1. **Start with templates** - Provide ready-to-use setups
2. **Document the process** - How to implement SPARK in [tool]
3. **Include screenshots** - Visual guides are helpful
4. **Test with real teams** - Get feedback before submitting
